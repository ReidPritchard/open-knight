1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {\"The so-called Dragon
variation. Korchnoi is probably the strongest player today who still employs it.
In particular, this opening was twice used by him in his candidates match in
1971 with Geller. In spite of the Dragon's then dubious reputation, Korchnoi
managed to get the good result in those games of 1:1.\"} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 Nc6 8.
Qd2 O-O 9. Bc4 {The Yugoslav Attack. 9.0-0-0 would seem much more in Karpov's
style today, but in his youth, he played many more attacking games like this
featuring gloriously fluid play.} 9... Bd7 10. h4 Rc8 11. Bb3 (11. g4 $4 {Many

O-O-O Nc4 13. Bxc4 Rxc4 14. h5 Nxh5 15. g4 Nf6 {\"This position was reached in
the fourth game of the aforementioned Geller-Korchnoi match. It should be
pointed out here that in the course of Korchnoi's preparations in the fall of
1971 for his match with Geller, he suggested to me that we play a training
match, to take place before his serious match with Geller. We agreed that our
Leningrad match would be of a \"closed\" character, and it is only now that I
can discuss it. At Korchnoi's request, I played five games with White and one,
the sixth, with Black. In short, the conditions were rather artificial. Due to
the fact that adjournments were to be played on the same day, I was not able to
win the first game, having only had a short break. Then, after winning the next
two games gave me a score of 2.5-0.5, I became cocky and promptly lost the two
that followed. The sixth game was drawn, though interesting. Thus, the final
result of this unknown match was 3:3 (+2, -2, $122).It should be realized that
this match was not beneficial only to Korchnoi but to me also; I had yet to be
come a grandmaster, and I was trying to reassure myself that I had the
confidence and playing strength to deserve the title. And so it was: I had not
lost to one of the world's strongest grandmasters $1 There quickly followed the
successes at the Alekhine Memorial and the Hastings Tournament. But let us
return to the Dragon Variation. Korchnoi and I had played quite a few speed
games with it, and here I played a move which, as I recall, I had played
before:\"} 16. Nde2 {\"Chumak, a chess player from the city of Dnepropetrovsk,
had made an attempt to strengthen this move and in 1972 had written an article
about it. The withdrawal of the knight from the center has a logical basis. The
square c3, very important for White's pieces, is becoming the focus of Black's
attention. It is on this square that a typical exchange sacrifice often occurs
(...Rxc3), with a strong attack for Black (it has been shown that after White's
pawns have been doubled in the c-file, Black's position is strong enough even
without a direct attack: i.e., he still has equality in the endgame, as was
splendidly demonstrated by the Soviet grandmaster Leonid Stein, whose untimely
death occurred not long ago). The point of 16.Nde2 is to strengthen the knight
on c3. Moreover, the knight on e2 can easily be transferred to the attack on the
kingside. As the reader has certainly noted by now, the players are attacking on
opposite sides without regard for material, as is often the case when castling
occurs on opposite flanks. These considerations should not obscure the concrete
threat that White has now created along the d-file: 17.e5 and 18.g5.\"} (16. Bh6
{This is too hasty, but 16...Nxe4, but Black still needs to play vigorously and
sac the exchange to gain a good position.} 16... Nxe4 17. Qe3 Rxc3 $1 (17... Nxc3 $2
18. Bxg7 $18) 18. bxc3 Nf6 $13) 16... Qa5 $2 (16... Re8 $3 {Only this move seems truly

g5 $18) 18. fxg4 Bxg4 19. e6 Bxe6 20. Bd4 $16) 17... Bh8 $15) 17. Bh6 {\"A typical
maneuver. The bishop on g7 must be exchanged in order for White to develop his
attack successfully. It is the only defender of the dark squares surrounding the
king, and its long-range power can also be effective along the h8-al diagonal,
its sights trained on the White queenside. In such positions, GM Vladimir
Simagin, one of the most creative chess players of our time, would even go in
for a thematic exchange sacrifice (...Bg7-h8, allowing Bh6xf8), preserving his
favorite bishop.\"} 17... Bxh6 (17... Bh8 $5 {Even here, Simagin's sacrifice may
well be best though Karpov must be better.} 18. Bxf8 Kxf8 $16) 18. Qxh6 Rfc8 19.
Rd3 {\"Until this point, Korchnoi and I had both been playing at blitz speed.
Now I played a move which I had prepared earlier. My opponent went into deep
thought. The innovation 19.Rd3 overprotects c3, and simultaneously frees the
knight on e2 for the attack in several lines. If White tried to break through
immediately without this move - 19.g6 Nh5 20.Ng3 - he would have the unpleasant
surprise 20...Rxc3; that will not be feasible after the text move.\"} 19... R4c5
{\"When I analyzed 19.Rd5 during my preparations for this match, I came to the
conclusion that the best counter to it was 19...R8c5. It is not strange that
after 36 minutes of thought, Korchnoi came tot he same conclusion - that it was
necessary to ensure himself against the gradually threatening pawn storm e4-e5
followed by g4-g5. I suggest, however, that Black's best practical chance is
Botvinnik's suggestion 19...Qd8. Now, after spending 18 minutes trying to refute
19...R4c5, I found a pretty, forced combination.\"} 20. g5 $3 {A beautiful
solution $1 This forcing combination allows Karpov to disrupt the 5th-rank
defenses that are keeping the knight on f6 in place and stopping ideas like
Nf4-h5. It is amazing, but Korchnoi will resign in just six more moves.} 20...

this move would have no threats, but now the queen and rook are under attack,

1. e4 {Kasparov has won many brilliant attacking games with both 1.e4 and 1.d4.
Here he pursues an open game.} 1... d6 $5 {Kasparov is probably THE greatest
opening theoretician of all time so it makes sense to avoid main lines against
him. Topalov selects the less common Pirc Defense, but now he runs the risk of
getting in trouble not because he is outprepared, but because the opening may be
slightly dubious at the highest level.} 2. d4 {It is of course correct to
establish the \"perfect pawn center\" against almost any hypermodern opening.}
2... Nf6 {Topalov attacks the e4-pawn. A difference between the King's Indian
Defense (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6) and the Pirc Defense (1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6) is that it is
natural now to play Nc3 which block the c-pawn that has already advanced to c4
in the King's Indian.} 3. Nc3 {Kasparov develops and defends e4.} 3... g6
{Topalov commits to the true \"Pirc\" defense with a kingside fianchetto. He
could still have changed course and played ...e5 and played a \"Philidor
Defense\" instead.} 4. Be3 {As is his way, Kasparov selects an aggressive setup,
developing the bishop to pursue a quick queen and bishop battery and castle
queenside.} 4... Bg7 {completing the fianchetto.} 5. Qd2 {This move already
prepares queenside castling and Bh6. Kasparov's attacking ideas are taking
shape.} 5... c6 $5 {An intriguing and flexible move $1 Rather than castling (which
most beginners would play), Topalov adopts a very flexible expansion on the
queenside which waits to see how Kasparov will deploy his forces without
creating targets.} (5... Ng4 $6 {Exchanging the dark-square bishop would be a
huge strategic achievement, but Topalov would only overextend if he tried this
move.} 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 $16 {The dark-square bishop survives, and
Black's advanced kingside pawns may easily become targets.}) (5... O-O
{Naturally Topalov avoids castling into the attack (though this is playable)
when Kasparov would be able to fully commit to the wing assault.}) 6. f3 {This
is a very useful (often essential) move in such positions. Kasparov secures e4
and keeps a knight out of g4.} 6... b5 {Topalov expands on the queenside,
creating prospects for an attack on White's king after 0-0-0, thinking about
inconveniencing the c3-knight after ...b4, and giving space to the Bc8 to
develop.} 7. Nge2 {This move is slightly odd since the knight has nowhere good
to go right away and blocks the Bf1. Topalov has benefited slightly from his
wait-and-see approach that makes it hard for Kasparov to commit his forces.} (7.
Bd3 $14 {Stockfish prefers developing the bishop and TH $146 playing Nge2.}) 7...
Nbd7 {The knight develops to it's most natural square, controlling e5 and c5.}
8. Bh6 {A very committal decision from Kasparov. He elects to exchange the
\"dragon bishop,\" but he must sideline his queen to achieve this strategic
goal.} 8... Bxh6 {Topalov pulls Kasparov's queen to h6, where it is misplaced.}
(8... O-O $2 {This would be very risky as Kasparov can immediately launch a
kingside attack.} 9. h4 $16) 9. Qxh6 {recapturing} 9... Bb7 {The bishop develops
and adds important control to the d5-square.} 10. a3 {Kasparov takes a moment to
stop ...b4.} (10. Qg7 {Many beginners might play (or be worried about) this
move.} 10... Rg8 {White can only retreat and as Black was never castling
kingside anyway, nothing was accomplished.}) 10... e5 {Topalov finally makes a
control commitment. He also shows his plan, ...Qe7 and 0-0-0.} (10... a5 $5 $14
{The engine preferred more queenside expansion. It's move 10 and both players
are still trying to figure out development and castling.}) 11. O-O-O {Now that
Topalov has committed, Kasparov does too. ...e5 weakens the d-file, and it is
the perfect time to castle and put a rook on it.} 11... Qe7 {Topalov places the
queen in a perfect spot. It defends the dark-squares on all sides of the board
and secures e5.} 12. Kb1 $1 {A grandmaster move $1 Kasparov is patient and places
his king on the safer b1-square and frees c1 for his e2-knight.} 12... a6
{Topalov secures b5  as d5 could have created problems.} 13. Nc1 $1 {The knight
repositions and frees the f1-bishop.} 13... O-O-O {Topalov finally castles. In a
classical sense, it is only here that we have left the opening as both players
are mostly developed and are castled.} 14. Nb3 {The knight finishes it's journey
and has a possible new target, a5.} 14... exd4 {Topalov can find no further
improvements so he decides it's time to release the central tensions. Although
his king is open, he is hoping his better centralized pieces (see the Bf1, Rh1,
and Qh6) can benefit from central action.} 15. Rxd4 {Recapturing with the knight
was of roughly equal value.} 15... c5 {The b7-bishop is released with a gain of
tempo on the rook.} 16. Rd1 {The rook retreats to the first rank.} 16... Nb6
{This one move activates both the knight and the Rd8 in the fight for d5. Black
hopes to advance ...d5 soon.} 17. g3 {Kasparov needs to active his f1-bishop and
h1-rook so he prepares Bh3.} 17... Kb8 {Topalov simply anticiaptes Bh3+} 18.
Na5 $6 {This complex phase sees several inaccuracies from both players. Kasparov
plays to trade off the b7-bishop, but Topalov can let him have it and use the
time gained to break in the center.} (18. Qf4 $16) 18... Ba8 $6 {Topalov keeps the
bishop, but he did not have to do so.} (18... d5 $1 {This was the perfect time to
break in the center $1} 19. Nxb7 Kxb7 20. exd5 Nfxd5 $12 {Black's king feels drafty,
but his central pieces offset this concern and give him equality.}) 19. Bh3 $2
{Kasparov develops the bishop, but it would not be so useful on h3 had Topalov
responded accurately on move 24.} (19. Qf4 $16 {again, it was better to
recentralize.}) 19... d5 $1 {Topalov finally strikes out $1 His king is opened up,
but his pieces are activated. Black is even better.} 20. Qf4+ {The queen
recentralizes with a check. She's been longing to do so.} 20... Ka7 {Topalov's
king appears to be fairly safe on a7...} 21. Rhe1 {Kasparov finally develops his
lat piece. Don't wait until move 21 to develop your rooks, kids $1} 21... d4
{Topalov keeps the e-file from opening and asks the knight to passively
retreat.} 22. Nd5 {Kasparov strives to avoid passivity and advances so as to
avoid the e-file. This is the move which commits Kasparov to a sacrificial path
as (at a minimum) he will lose a pawn on d5.} 22... Nbxd5 {This is the correct
knight to capture with as the black king has access to b6 now.} 23. exd5
{opening the e-file.} 23... Qd6 {The queen blockades the d-pawn which appears to
be a goner.} 24. Rxd4 $3 {A thunderous move $3 $1 Kasparov sacrifices a rook in the
hope of a mating attack. Topalov has a huge decision here. Should he accept the
audacious sacrifice or decline $2} (24. Nc6+ $5 {This might be the \"best\" course
of action, but only Black can be better in the endgame, and Topalov will have
little way to go wrong.} 24... Bxc6 25. Qxd6 Rxd6 26. dxc6 $17) 24... cxd4 $2
{Topalov accepts, following one of my favorite maxims, \"If you cannot see a
reason not to take material, take it. You will either get material or a
lesson.\" Here Topalov gets a lesson as Kasparov's sacrifice proves sound. We
should all be grateful to Topalov for being willing to venture down this road,
but declining the sacrifice could have gained a clear advantage.} (24... Kb6 $1
{This move was much cited after the match. Instead of taking the rook, Black
plays a daring king move and places the knight on a5 and the rook under attack.
This disrupts White's mating patterns, and an endgame is now unavoidable.} 25.

There are decent winning chances.}) (24... Rhe8 $2 {I quite like this move which
activates the last undeveloped piece. I think this give the most winning chances
to Black.} 25. Rxe8 Nxe8 26. Qxf7+ $16) 25. Re7+ $3 {A second rook sacrifice to
justify the first $1 This one cannot be accepted though.} (25. Qxd4+ $4 Qb6 26.
