We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the [code of conduct].

## How to contribute

Before you start forking, please open an issue to discuss your idea. This will allow us to give you feedback and help you shape your contribution. It also helps us keep track of what's being worked on so we can avoid duplicating effort and merge your work more quickly. As I'm the only contributor at the moment, this would help me out a lot!

Once you've got an issue assigned to you, you can start working on your contribution.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/open-knight.git

Set up your machine by following the instructions in the README.

Once you've made your changes, push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/reidpritchard/open-knight/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. I like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). I or others may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. Once all comments are addressed, your PR will be merged!

Some things that will speed up the process:

* Create an issue before starting work on a new feature!!
* Keep your PR focused on a single issue. Small PRs move much faster.
* Write tests for your changes. Once we get to a release candidate, I'll likely require tests for all changes.
* Link to any relevant issues in your PR description.
